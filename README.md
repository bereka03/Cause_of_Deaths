## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the global causes of death from 1990 to 2020, focusing on identifying the trends, patterns, and the most significant contributors to the overall mortality rates worldwide.
## Data
The dataset used in this analysis includes information on the number of deaths for various countries and disease categories from 1990 to 2020. The data was obtained from a reliable source and covers a comprehensive set of causes of death, including cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, and more.

## Results
